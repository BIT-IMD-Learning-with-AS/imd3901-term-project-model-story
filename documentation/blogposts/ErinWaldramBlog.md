# Milestone Reflections - ERIN WALDRAM #

## Milestone 1 : "A Journey Begins" ##
 - _Date: 2022-01-31_
 - _Number of Hours: ~4_

 ### Overview ###
    Welcome to my first blog post as a member and project manager of Model&Story!
    Model&Story is a team of 5 Carleton University students, with varying skill sets.
    The team consists of myself, Chloe V., Chris H., Gavin I., and Zoe P.
    Our first official week working together had us selecting one of three major projects    
    to complete throughout the duration of this semester, along with setting up the GitHub  
    repositories, Google Drive folders, Trello boards, and any other forgotten  
    administrative task necessary for our team's beginnings.  
    Aditionally, team roles and general aesthetic has been chosen, and future meetings  
    have been planned to fully flesh out our chosen topic.

 ### Challenges ###
    Our challenges this week primarily involved around how new and budding our project is. 
    Without many prior classes discussing our overall goals and deliverables, as well as a  
    proper application design yet to be made, some decisions proved harder to make than  
    others. We did, however, manage to get on our feet rather quickly.
    As we execute more meetings and all ambiguity on our project fades, our list of  
    challenges will likely extend.
    Another small challenge I personally faced was in the creation of the Trello board.  
    Without a clear, defined design, it's more difficult for me to plan out manageable 
    tasks for my team. That said, as the ambiguity fades, I'll be able to run my team more  
    effectively, and creating clear plans for our design is my primary goal at the moment.

 ### Successes ###
    We were successful and efficient this week in choosing our various roles with minimal  
    fighting for positions. Our team seems as though it will be well suited to working  
    together, with all aspects of design necessary for our project covered by one  
    individual at minimum. 
    Selecting a project also went efficiently, as we all had equal interest in our chosen  
    topic. A unanimous vote had our most important decision easily made.

 
 ### Media ###
    Without any code available for our main project, I'm including the general 
    low-polygonal aesthetic we hope to use as inspiration throughout our project.
